// What is the difference between var and let?
// Var allows you to reassign and redeclare. You are not able to do this with let.

// What is the difference between var and const?
// You can reassign and redeclare with var, but you can not redeclare or reassign using the const keyword. 
// You can access a hoisted variable with var. Const creates block scope.

// What is the difference between let and const?
// Let allows you to reassign, but you are not able to do that with const.

// What is hoisting?
// Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. 
// Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” 
// they are defined in a codebase.
